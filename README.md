# Login module

Simple register and login module for any java program.

## How to integrate in a program

In the class com.jorgedress.loginmodule.register.connectionClass, line 28, is declarated the database and its parameters. 

## About the Database

I recomend XAMPP for making databases, make one called "login" and a table called "login" too, with:

```SQL
Name: TEXT, UNIQUE
Password: BLOB
ID: INT, AUTO_INCREMENT
```
